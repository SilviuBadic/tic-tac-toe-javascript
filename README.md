# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple, two-player game played on a grid of 3-by-3 squares, usually drawn on a piece of paper. The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row. If the game ends and there is no winner, then there will be a tie.

## Features

1 -- The main objects of the game (my hands). Three buttons (left - rock, middle - paper, right - scissors). <br>
2 -- The result represented by two small thumbnails. My choice vs. computer's choices. <br>
3 -- The outputs represented by: a text calling the winner, a text representing competitors choices, a text that numbers the winns, losses and ties throughout the game. <br>
4 -- Two features which add a bit of complexity to the game: Autoplay, my choices being randomly chosen by the computer. One reset button which resets the score whenever we press the button. <br>

## Lessons Learned
Other than working with functions, I've managed to deepen my knowledge in construction Conditional Statements, creating functionalities and relations between different functions and objects. I've learned a bit about JSON syntax, I've put some addEventListeners to work.
## Optimizations.

- Applying JSON for storing and transporting data.
- Applying event listeners using keydown event, which occurs just when we press 'R' for choosing the Rock object, 'S' for choosing the Scissors object and 'P' for Paper. This method will immediately trigger.
- Conditional statements.
