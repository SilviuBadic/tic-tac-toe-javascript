# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple, two-player game played on a grid of 3-by-3 squares, usually drawn on a piece of paper, and can be played by people of any age.  <br><br>
In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing "X" always goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game is a draw.

I wanted to customise it a bit by choosing to add two more features, such as the random choice from which the computer will place an O on the grid, and the buttons and outputs which let us manipulate the game and find the winner.

## Features

1 -- The main 3-by-3 grid where the players successively place Xs and Os until the game ends.<br>
2 -- We can't start the game without pressing the Start button. Also, in case we want to reset the game, we can refresh the page or just press the Reset button and 
the tiles will be blank again. <br>
3 -- In case we win the game, the output will show "WELL DONE HUMAN", in case the computer wins it will be displayed "WELL DONE PC", else "IT'S A TIE". <br>

## Lessons Learned
It was a good project to learn more about DOM manipulations and the relation between functions. Also a good way to improve my CSS skills too.
## Optimizations.

- DOM manipulation, functions, iterations, loops;
- Random number used to help the computer choose a tile and place it on the grid;
- Event listeners;
- Using of "this" keyword.
